                    This website is dedicated to my friend, Honey. Honey is working in an origami studio.
                    She always wanted to show his creativity and post it online. So he decided to make 
                    a website of his own and asked me to help. Here he wishes to explain 
                    step-by-step how origami is made. I hope you all enjoy making the origami.
